        <h1 style="color: white;">THE 6 BIGGEST MYTHS & MISTAKES in BUILDING MUSCLES</h1>
 
 
        <div style="background-color: lightsteelblue;">
            <h2>Nine out of ten guys you see in the gym don’t train correctly. In many cases, I wouldn’t even bother getting out of bed in the morning to do their training routines.
            They’re usually following programs they found in magazines or on the internet, or maybe they got them from friends or trainers. They are stuck in a rut of no gains or eking out slow, stubborn gains.
            Most guys also compound their training mistakes by eating incorrectly(chalo bhai gym k baad chappan chalet hai)—they’re eating too much, eating too little, eating on a bad schedule, not getting the right amounts and types of macronutrients, and are making other various muscle-robbing mistakes. Eating for maximum muscle gain or fat loss means little more than meeting precise nutritional requirements on a precise schedule (and there’s nothing hard about doing it—it just requires exactness).
            So, I’d like to take a moment here to address the six most common myths and mistakes of building lean muscle, because chances are good that you have fallen victim to one or more of them at some point in the past (and if you haven’t, it’s probably because you’re brand new, which actually gives you a great advantage: You get to do it right from day one!).</h2>

                    <h1>MYTH & MISTAKE #1:</h1>
                    <h2>More Sets = More Growth (jyaada karuga to jyaada body banegi hehe)
                        I don’t know about you, but I hate long workouts. Who wants to spend two hours in a gym every day(suno re gym freako gym k baahar bhi zindagi hai)? Only the over-zealous newbies who think that the grueling seventeenth set is where the growth occurs, or the obsessed 'roid-heads who like to squat until their noses bleed and deadlift until they puke (you would have observed these types of guys “workout kam aur chilla chot jyaada).
                        The fact is, too many sets can actually lead to overtraining, which not only robs you of muscle growth and makes you feel run-down and lethargic, but can actually cause you to lose muscle. Yes, that’s right—two hours of intense lifting can actually make you shrink and get weaker. You are simply breaking down the muscle too much for your body to repair optimally. Of course you don’t want to under-train either by doing  too little, which is why at FITNERD we recommend weight workouts that are built to achieve the maximum muscle overload and stimulation that your body can efficiently repair.
                        More sets also means more time spent working out, of course, and this too can become detrimental. As you exercise, your body releases hormones such as testosterone, growth hormone, and insulin, all conducive to muscle growth. In response to the physical stress, however, your body also releases a hormone called cortisol. This hormone helps increase blood sugar levels and fight inflammation, but it also interferes with your body’s ability to use protein correctly and stops muscle growth. One of the best ways to control cortisol is to keep your training sessions short.
                        Scientific studies, such as the one done by the University of Natal, have shown that weight training sessions between 45 – 60 minutes allow for proper muscle stimulation while maximizing testosterone production and minimizing cortisol production. Cardio sessions between 30 – 45 minutes were found to be the best for the same reasons. Post-workout nutrition is a huge part of managing cortisol too, but we’ll get to that later.
                        The bottom line is that if your lifting program is built correctly, you can achieve stunning muscle gains by weight training for no longer than 45 – 60 minutes per day. (kam time mein jyaada aur kya chahiye bro )</h2>

                    <h2>You Have to “Feel the Burn” to Grow
                        ( dukhne tak lagauga to hi “baadi” banegi)
                        How many times have you heard training partners yelling for each other to “Make it burn!”(bhai ek aur laga feel the burn you can do it !) and “Get another three reps!”? They think that pumping out reps until the stinging pain is unbearable causes maximum growth. “No pain, no gain,” right? Wrong. This is probably one of the worst fallacies out there. Muscle “burn” and pump are not paramount in achieving muscle growth.
                        When your muscles are burning, what you’re actually feeling is a buildup of lactic acid in the muscle, which builds as you contract your muscles again and again. Lactic acid does trigger what’s known as the “anabolic cascade,” which is a cocktail of growth-inducing hormones, but when lactic acid levels become too elevated, studies have shown that it actually impairs growth and causes tissues to be broken down.
                        So, for yet another reason, when guys spend a couple of hours in the gym pounding away with drop sets, burnout sets, supersets, and so forth, they’re doing much more harm than good.
                        So what does cause maximum muscle growth, then? The short answer is overload, which you can read on other article titled principles of muscle building</h2>

                    <h1>MYTH & MISTAKE #3:</h1>
                    <h2>Wasting Time with the Wrong Exercise 
            
                        In case you didn’t know, most of what your gym has to offer in terms of workout machines and contraptions is worthless. Why? Because they just don’t stimulate the muscles like free weights do. (Free weights, by the way, are objects like dumbbells, barbells, adjustable pulleys, and lat pull-down setups that can be moved in three-dimensional space.) [adhe se jyaada log to heavy lifting se darte hai isliye mehengi gym lagwate aur treadmill pe daud lagate aur sochte  “ha meri body ban jaayegi , aur phir preeti ko pata looga”]
                        There’s something oddly effective about forcing the body to freely manipulate weight, unaided, against the pull of gravity. Nobody ever built a great chest by just pounding away on the Pec Deck and Machine Press—they used barbells and dumbbells.
                        More specifically, the most effective muscle-building exercises are known as compound exercises. They’re called compound exercises because they involve multiple muscle groups. Examples of compound exercises are the Squat, Deadlift, and Bench Press. The opposite of a compound exercise is an isolation exercise, which involves one muscle group only. Examples of isolation exercises are the Cable Flye, Dumbbell Curl, and Leg Extension.
                        Numerous scientific studies have confirmed the benefits of compound exercises over isolation exercises. One such study was conducted at Ball State University in 2000, and it went like this:
                        Two groups of men trained with weights for ten weeks. Group one did four compound upper-body exercises, while group two did the same plus bicep curls and triceps extensions (isolation exercises).
                        After the training period, both groups increased strength and size, but which do you think had bigger arms? The answer is neither. The additional isolation training performed by group two produced no additional effect on arm strength or circumference. The takeaway is that by overloading your entire system, you cause everything to grow.
                        Charles Poliquin, trainer to world-class athletes like Olympians and professional sports players, is fond of saying that in order to gain an inch on your arms, you have to gain ten pounds of muscle. His point is the most effective way to build a big, strong body is with systemic overload, not localized training. If your weight training program isn’t built around heavy, compound training, you’re only making a fraction of the gains possible.
                        Now, I’m not saying that bicep curls and triceps extensions are entirely worthless. I’ve found that certain isolation exercises, if incorporated into a routine properly (using the right amount of weight and volume—the total number of sets—per workout), do help with strength and growth. So you will find a few isolation exercises in our recommendations program, but they are hardly the focus.
                        Guys that make the mistake of doing ineffective exercises often believe another myth, which is the lie that you have to constantly change up your routine to make gains(gym ka wo banda jo roz ajib ajib exercise dhund k laata internet se ye sochke ki cool laguga). This is complete nonsense peddled by the garbage. You’re in the gym to get bigger and stronger, and that requires three simple things: lift progressively heavier weights, eat correctly, and give your body sufficient rest.</h2>

                    <h1>MYTH & MISTAKE #4:</h1>
                    <h2>Lifting Like an Idiot
                        One of the most painful sights in gyms is the hordes of ego lifters (tum isko jante ho jhooth mat bolna gym ka wo londa jo 300 kg ki deadlift lagata bilkul hi galat form mein chilla chilla )spastically throwing around weights with reckless abandon. I cringe not only out of pity but out of the anticipation of injuries that could strike at any moment.
                        While it might seem like another shocking generality, it’s true nonetheless. Most guys don’t have a clue as to the proper form of exercises. This ignorance stunts their gains, causes unnecessary wear and tear on ligaments, tendons, and joints, and opens the door to debilitating injuries (especially as weights get heavy on things like the shoulders, elbows, knees, and lower back).
                        Some of these guys just don’t know any better, and some are more interested in looking cool than in making real gains. You’re not going to fall into this trap. You’re going to do your exercises with perfect form, and while your weights may be lighter than Mr. Huff and Puff, he’ll be secretly wondering why you look so much better</h2>

                    <h1>MYTH & MISTAKE #5:</h1>
                    <h2>Lifting Like a Wussy
                        Building a great body is a pain in the butt. It takes considerable time, effort, discipline, and dedication. I don’t care what anybody tells you—it doesn’t come easy.
                        Quite frankly, most guys like to train like wussies(inke liye ham ujjainwale ek word use karte hai “dhillange”). They don’t want to push themselves. They don’t want to exert too much effort. And of course, their bodies don’t change much. They come in each day an exact duplicate of the last. Eventually, they quit out of despair and frustration.
                        Well, they are giving in to one of our most primal instincts. We humans instinctively avoid pain and discomfort and seek pleasure and ease in life. But, if we let that inclination color our workouts, we’re doomed.
                        Working out correctly is a bit counter-intuitive. It’s intense and uncomfortable. Sometimes you just don’t want to do that final exercise. Sometimes you dread that next set of squats. Muscle soreness can be annoying. Sometimes joints and tendons can ache.
                        But, these things are all just a part of the game, and if you push through them and resolve that your body IS going to meet the goals you set for it, then you’re going to make great gains—period.</h2>

                    <h2>Eating to Stay Small or Get Fat
                    As you’ve probably heard, you grow outside of the gym, and that requires sufficient rest and proper nutrition. Many guys get both wrong—they overtrain and don’t eat enough calories (or eat way too many), don’t get enough protein (or way too much), eat bad carbs and fats, and don’t schedule and proportion their meals correctly.
                    If you don’t eat enough calories and get enough protein, carbs, and fats throughout the day, you simply don’t grow. It doesn’t matter how hard you lift—if you don’t eat enough, you won’t gain any muscle to speak of. On the other hand, if you eat too many calories, eat too many bad carbs and fats, and don’t know how to size your meals properly, you can gain muscle, but it will be hidden underneath an ugly sheath of unnecessary fat.
                    When you know how to eat properly, however, you can gain eye-popping amounts of muscle while staying lean, and you can lose layers of fat while maintaining, if not, increasing muscle mass.
